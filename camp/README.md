I created the objects in JS.
Made a link from the home page to the data page.
Put all the necessary information of the home page and data page for now.
I created a new HTML file , 'analysis.HTML', to create a relative link.
Basic CSS on the homepage.

Created a home site (font-end) website for Campfire Coffee. Used all the images and the slogan given to us. Put the location and an address and phone number (both fake) for the locations. Created an 'about us' section and a schedule of when they are open. Put the shop and sustainability  pages on the navigation bar (in plain site). Back-end page generates two table the JS is pretty efficient. I'm sure I could make the table into prototypes if I had more time. Maybe tomorrow.
